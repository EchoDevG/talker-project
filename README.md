# dad-talker
VB.NET program to allow dad to talk



This is a small and pointless program designed to let my dad talk without a voicebox. 


It has two main features: 

~~ Communication between a client laptop (windows 10) and server pc (windows 7) using system.net.sockets in VB.NET

~~ Reading the messages recieved out loud to make it easier for everyone to hear him using System.speech.Synthesizer
