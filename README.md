# dad-talker
VB.NET program to allow dad to talk



This is a small and pointless program designed to let my dad talk without a voicebox. 


It has two main features: 

~ Communication between a client laptop (windows 10) and server pc (windows 7) using system.net.sockets in VB.NET

~ Reading the messages recieved out loud to make it easier for everyone to hear him using System.speech.Synthesizer



To use, copy and paste the client-sender.vb file into a visual studio project in module1. Copy background-stuff client.vb into module2 of the same project.
For the server, copy and paste server-reciever.vb into a new visual studio project.



I'm working on neatening this up so you can download a file and that is what works, I'll do that tonight when I get home and actually connct VS to github.
Enjoy!
